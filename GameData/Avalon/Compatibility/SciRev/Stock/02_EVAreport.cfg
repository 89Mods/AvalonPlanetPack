	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = Squad/Sun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Solakku is very bright. Probably shouldn’t look at it for very long.
				InSpaceLow = You have to actively resist the temptation to directly look at Solakku. Your sensitive eyes would not survive.
				Flying = WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! STOP IT!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Infernum
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You try and peek a glance at Infernum. "Oof, ouch, my eyes!"
				FlyingHigh = Too hot! Nope! Time to get back inside!
				FlyingLow = You realize just how screwed you may be. Mission control acknowledges.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Magnus
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Nope, still bright!
				InSpaceLow = You can almost feel the heat from all that lava radiating up towards you, making you sweat.
				SrfLandedHighlands = You take in the view. You can see some lava lakes far, far in the distance. Good. That’s where they should be.
				SrfLandedMidlands = You still feel unsafe here. Better to be quick with whatever you need to do here.
				SrfLandedMaria = Despite your flight instinct kicking in, you kinda wanna get a bit close to one of the lava lakes, just to see.
				SrfSplashed = "This is fine." you say into your radio as your space suit begins to melt "Everything will be okay."
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Solvis
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Despite the fact that it doesn’t look like Avalon at all up close, you’re still in awe of its size.
				FlyingHigh = Just because doing this is safe on Avalon, doesn’t mean you can do it just anywhere! Get back inside!
				FlyingLow = You wish you could take of your suit and fly under your own power here, but the atmosphere isn’t breathable, and the gravity would make you crash instantly.
				SrfLanded = You try to jump, but gravity is holding you down firmly. You can barely move.
				SrfSplashed = You can’t believe you’re swimign in molten ice. You’re only alive right now because of your spacesuit’s cooling systems. At least it’ll make for a great story to tell.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Mol
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The ground here is composed of many tiny ice crystals. It reminds you of the icy planes back home, if they were also made out of sharp needles. You probably shouldn’t let too much of it get on your spacesuit, no matter how tempting it is to try and throw a snowball.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Valaya
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You look back at Avalon, then at Valaya. The difference in scale between the two is difficult to comprehend.
				InSpaceLow = You get an even clearer look at the clouds below. You wonder what it’d look like to fly in them, although its probably for the best you don’t find out.
				FlyingLow = What happened to "probably not for the best"? Lets you hope you have a way to get out of this one!
			}
		}
		Body

		//	Values
		//	{
		//		InSpaceHigh = You become lost in the view in front of you, until your radio beeps, and you’re reminded that you’re drifting away from your craft.
		//		FlyingLow = You feel compelled to get out of your spacesuit and fly the rest of the way home on your own wings, but mission control reminds you that it wouldn’t be a good Idea, with your muscles weakened by the time spent in zero gravity.
		//		SrfSplashed = You take a swim in Avalon’s seas, chirping happily as you drift along.
		//		SrfLanded = You form some of the snow on the ground into a ball and throw it as hard as you can. Yep, feels like home alright.
		//	}
		//}

		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Edith
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You squint your eyes, trying to make out Edith and its moons. You can definitely see its rings, though.

		{
			name = Avalon/Frost
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The cold air is quickly rushing past you, the pressure threatening to crush you. You contemplate how to deal with this situation.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Res
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Res looks almost like a demon, a dark shadow against the sky, only highlighted by an evil orange glow.

				SrfSplashed = I SAID GO BACK!
			}

				InSpaceLow = You scan for a suitable landing site, and find, like, 12 right away. You roll your eyes.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Musoya
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Staring down at Musoya, you wonder what else lies beyond it.
				FlyingLow = Its the not the same as actually feeling the air run through your feathers. Its just not.
				SrfLanded = Looking up at the sky makes your heart ache again. You dutifully prepare to plant your flag, trying not to think of how long the return journey will take.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Musoya
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Looking up at the sky, you spot Crest glowing its faintly orange color. Considering where you are right now, it suddenly doesn’t seem to be that far away anymore.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Talos
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You chirr and smile with every step you take. Mission control asks you what’s going on with you. You don’t know what they mean, you just feel so cute right now! Mission control decides you’ve gone insane from the isolation.

		{
			name = Avalon/Craig
