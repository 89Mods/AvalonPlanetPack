	@RESULTS
	{
		!InSpace = *
		InSpace = Most of the liquid samples boil off in the vacuum, while a few others begin to glow slightly from the exposure to radiation.
		Body
		{
			name = Squad/Sun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The liquid samples evaporate. Everything else begins to melt or glow red hot.
				Flying = All of the samples are destroyed instantly. Most of them vaporize.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Magnus
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = A few of the samples violently explode as they come in contact with the molten rock. Most just melt into it.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Solvis
			Values
			{
				Flying = The atmosphere here doesn’t appear to be doing anything particularly nasty to the samples. At least that’s a good sign.
				SrfLanded = The samples are mostly innert, except for the compass, which has alligned itself to Solvis’ magnetic field.

		//		SrfLanded = Nothing out of the ordinary is happening. What did you expect?
		//		SrfSplashed = A few of the samples dissolve into the ocean.
