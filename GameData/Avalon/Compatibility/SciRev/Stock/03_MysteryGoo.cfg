{
	@RESULTS
	{
		!InSpace = *
		InSpace = The goo almost instantly hardens in its outer layers, forming a protective shell around the inside, which continues to stay alive for a few minutes in its makeshift spacesuit, before dying from a lack of oxygen to breathe.
		FlyingHigh = The goo has to become extra sticky to not be flung out of the container. It tries to breathe what little of atmosphere there is, but quickly suffocates.
		
		Body
		{
			name = Squad/Sun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The goo quickly dries up under the intense sunlight. The outer layers become opaque and turn white in an attempt to reflect the light back, but the heat quickly overcomes it anyways, and it shrivels up.
				Flying = The goo is instantly vaporized before it has any time to react.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Magnus
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The glowing hot lava leaks into the container, burning the goo alive, which tries and fails to form a barrier of dried goo to protect itself.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Solvis
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo focuses all its efforts on trying to breathe Solvis’ atmosphere, seemingly ignoring that more and more of it is escaping the container until nothing is left.
				SrfLanded = The goo successfully switches to metabolizing the CO2 in Solvis’ atmosphere as its color shifts to a light purple, attempting to begin photosynthesizing. Its efforts are enough to barely keep it alive.
				SrfSplashed = Molten ice rushes into the container, causing the goo to intentionally form air bubbles inside it before the container completely floods. It survives for a few minutes, before slowly dying, probably due to a lack of nutrients and breathable gasses dissolved in the liquid.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Valaya
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo is not dealing too well with the high pressure, shrinking in size and hardening itself to resist. Unable to breathe the atmosphere here, its efforts quickly cease as it dies.
			}

		//Body
		//{
		//	name = Avalon/Avalon
		//	Values
		//	{
		//		SrfLanded = The goo is happily settling in its container. The environmental conditions today are perfect.
		//		FlyingLow = The goo is increasing its viscosity to prevent itself from being sucked out the holes in the container.
		//		FlyingHigh = The goo takes on a sponge-like form, to increase the amount of air it can absorb.
		//		SrfSplashed = The goo lets the liquid surround it, hardening its outer shells to prevent iself from dissolving. Air bubbles can be seen frequently escaping the goo shortly after, as it begins metabolizing the ammonia and any oxygen dissolved in the liquid.
		//	}
		//}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Nevu
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo captures as much of the escaping air in bubbles as it can before it hardens, trying to hold on until the atmospheric pressure rises a bit more.
				SrfLanded = The goo quickly adapts to metabolize CO2, but the atmosphere is so thin, it has to form a protective layer around itself to protect against what is almost a vacuum. It is barely clinging on to life.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Edith
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The strong air currents outside quickly suck all the goo out of the container before it can react.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Frost
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo begins to freeze in the cold winds, with the atmosphere also pushing down on it pretty hard. The combination of those forces quickly overwhelms the goo, reducing it to an ice crystal.
				SrfLanded = The goo leaks out of the container and onto the ground. It seems to allow its outer layers to freeze to isolate its core. A few minutes later, and a small collection of goo at the center remains warm. Is it metabolizing the Ammonia and CO2 in the ice?
				//SrfLanded = The goo allows itself to be crushed into a smaller, flatter shape, reducing its surface area as its outer layers quickly change composition, seemingly to a kind of substance better at isolating it from the cold. Its core manages to stay warm for a few more minutes, but the cells inside quickly die as they can’t process the atmosphere here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Musoya
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo quickly begins to freeze. It shrivels up and tries to change its outer layers to protect against the cold, but it is too quickly overwhelmed by the near absolute zero temperatures.
				SrfLanded = The goo quickly begins to freeze. It tries to escape the container, but freezes solid before it can make any progress.
