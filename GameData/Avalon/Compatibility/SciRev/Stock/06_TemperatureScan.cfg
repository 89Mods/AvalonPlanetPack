	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = Squad/Sun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = What a strange conundrum: the thermometer has melted. You don’t know how hot it is anymore.
				Flying = The thermometer decides its done with this, and shatters into pieces.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Infernum
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Even shielded from Solakku, the reflected light from Infernum is strong enough to significantly heat the thermometer. And the rest of your craft, for that matter.
				FlyingHigh = Temperature rising...
				FlyingLow = It seems almost impossible at this point, but its getting hotter still! The thermometer has maxed out LONG ago!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Magnus
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The thermometer is spiking just being near Magnus.
				SrfLanded = The surface is very hot, not even cooling down much during the night.
				SrfSplashed = The thermometer is melted quickly, but briefly manages to measure the temperature of the lava.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Solvis
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = Temperature surpassed what’s tolerable by Avali a little bit ago.
				SrfLanded = Its pretty hot outside. Any Avali coming here would definitely need good cooling in their spacesuits.
				SrfSplashed = The exact temperature of the liquid is measured. Yep, definitely molten ice.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Mol
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface here is surprisingly cold. It appears to be reflecting away a significant portion of the incident light.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Valaya
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = Its suddenly getting incredibly hot.
				FlyingHigh = Temperatures could be considered habitable if it weren’t for the lack of a solid ground.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Mov
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The ground is warmer than expected.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Ralu
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedBasins = These flat regions appear to be slightly cooler than the rest of the moon.
			}
		}
		//Body
		//{
		//	name = Avalon/Avalon
		//	Values
		//	{
		//		SrfLanded = A bit chilly, but otherwise fine weather today.
		//		SrfSplashed = The ocean is cold, but not uncomfortably so.
		//		FlyingLow = The craft rapidly cools as it lifts of the surface.
		//		FlyingHigh = Its freezing up here! How much colder is it going to get?
		//	}
		//}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Nevu
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Its difficult to measure the temperature of the atmosphere over that of the craft itself, but it appears to be fridgid!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Char
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The low albedo is heating up the surface quite a bit.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Edith
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The temperature spikes for quite a bit, before cooling below freezing.
				FlyingLow = The winds are icy cold at first, but quickly warm up as the craft passes through a convection zone.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Frost
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Its cold.
				FlyingLow = Its colder.
				SrfLanded = The word "cold" is insufficient to describe this situation, at this point. The thermometer is having trouble operating.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Res
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Even away from the lakes of lava, the surface is hot to the touch.
				SrfSplashed = The temperature is worrying. But this is fine.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Hamaea
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The temperatures are as predicted, down to the 3rd decimal. Nothing out of the ordinary here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Musoya
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Its even more freezing up here than on Frost!
				FlyingLow = It just keeps getting colder! When will it stop?
				SrfLanded = The thermometer has stopped functioning.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Arkunos
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This is probably the coldest place you’ve ever been to. There is basically no light from Solakku arriving here anymore.
			}
		}
