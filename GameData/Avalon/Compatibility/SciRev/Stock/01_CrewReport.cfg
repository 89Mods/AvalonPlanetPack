	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = Squad/Sun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You question how you’re still alive right now as you desparately try to shield your eyes from the light strong enough to shine through your hands.
				InSpaceHigh = You wonder how long your journey is going to take.
				InSpaceHigh = Looking at Solakku through a filter lense reveals just a tiny, barely visible dot.
				InSpaceHigh = You look outside, trying to make out Valaya or even Avalon, but without success.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Infernum
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Infernum zooms past below you at incredible speed. Slowing down here would be difficult.
				InSpaceLow = You still can’t make out any of Infernum’s features. Its just too bright!
				Flying = As if your craft wasn’t already hot enough, Infernum’s atmosphere are only warming it up more. You begin to doubt you’ll survive this little stunt of yours.
				FlyingLow = You’re about to pass out from the heat penetrating your spacecraft, hoping that whatever plan mission control has to get you back works. They do have a plan, right?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Magnus
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The planet’s surface is mostly obscured by how much light its reflecting, creating a strong glare through the window. Maybe a more direct look would help?
				InSpaceLow = Even the dark side of the planet is lit up, but by molten rock that you feel like you’re already dangerously close to.
				SrfLandedHighlands = With how high the hill you’ve landed on is, you’re finally able to convince yourself that you’re far enough from those oceans of lava to be safe.
				SrfLandedMidlands = You’re a bit on edge, constantly expecting a lava flow to suddenly errupt out of the ground next to your craft.
				SrfLandedMaria = You cautiously eye the lake of molten rock not too far from your craft. You don’t exactly feel like leaving your craft and taking that giant leap anymore.
				SrfSplashed = You begin to scream as you realize where your craft has just landed. You hope your craft’s engine hasn’t melted yet, and you can still escape.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Solvis
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The planet below you reminds you of home with its vibrant blue atmosphere and oceans. You conveniently manage to ignore the fact that the color of the land is all wrong.
				InSpaceLow = No denying now that this planet is not like Avalon at all. The ground beneath you looks brown like dried-up plants.
				Flying = The craft vibrates heavily. Where Avalon’s atmosphere is like a pillow softly holding you up, Solvis’ seems intent on shaking your craft appart.
				FlyingLow = Atmospheric pressure is relatively low still, and you’re almost touching the surface. It doesn’t look like an Avali could walk here without a pressure suit.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Mol
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You sketch out the two different looking halves of Mol. But even up close they’re still as mysterious as ever.
				InSpaceLow = Closer observation shows the darker side of Mol to be almost entirely flat. You wonder why that is.
				InSpaceLow = The brighter side of Mol varies radically in height. You are suddenly worried about your craft crashing into the side of one of these mountains.
				SrfLanded = Your landing has blown up what looks like really fine snow. Its taking a while to settle in the low gravity.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Valaya
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You watch Avalon in the distance, smaller than you’ve ever seen it before. You wonder just how far your journeys will take you.
				InSpaceLow = You can make out cloud patterns with your bare eyes that you’d usually only be able to see with a telescope. You regret not having brought a telescope to see what deeper secrets could be revealed here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Mov
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You’re finally inside Mov’s graviational influence. You almost started believing it didn’t exist.
				SrfLanded = The craft wobbles on the uneven terrain. You hold your breath, waiting for it to stop moving.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Rinala
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You begin counting all the tall volcanoes you see on the moon.
				SrfLandedVolcanos = Mission control tells you the volcano you’ve landed on is long dormant. Somehow, you’re sceptical.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Ralu
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Its even more beautiful up close!
				InSpaceLow = The warped surface below you looks beautiful, but is almost entirely devoid of good landing spots. As the almost entirely flat maria come into view, you realize that they are your best shot.
				SrfLandedBasins = You instantly regret having chosen this landing spot. It might’ve been safer, but there’s also nothing to see. Its just flat in every direction.
				SrfLanded = It was quite daring, landing on this part of Ralu, but you know it will have been worth the risk.
			}
		}
		//Body
		//{
		//	name = Squad/Kerbin
		//	Values
		//	{
		//		InSpaceHigh = From so far away, Avalon’s atmosphere looks like a soft blanket surrounding the moon, protecting it and keeping it warm.
		//		InSpaceLow = You’re in space! Finally! Escaping Avalon’s tall atmosphere was journey in itself.
		//		Flying = It looks like you’re almost in space, but nope, there is still a lot of atmosphere to get through before that!
		//		SrfSplashed = The craft wobbles softly in the waves. After everything you’ve been through, its very soothing. You fall asleep, waiting for the recovery craft to arrive.
		//		SrfLanded = You’re home!
		//	}
		//}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Nevu
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Unlike Avalon, this moon’s atmosphere is barely visible as a soft orange glow.
				InSpaceLow = It seems the icy regions will make for the most optimal landing site.
				Flying = Mission control tells you you’ve entered Nevu’s atmosphere. You’re a bit confused. Nothing appears to have changed about your situation.
				FlyingLow = The air is barely slowing you down. You’ll have to use your engines to slow down the rest of the way before landing.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Char
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Char looks like a shadow against the backdrop of the galaxy.
				InSpaceLow = You wonder if landing inside one of those ridges would be possible.
				SrfLanded = Your craft has landed at an angle, but gravity doesn’t seem to be trying to tip it over very much. You’re easily keeping upright.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Edith
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Edith looks tiny out the window, but apparently its gravity already has a hold on you.
				InSpaceLow = The bands of clouds below you are visibly moving at high speeds. You’d hate getting caught up in winds like that.
				FlyingLow = The strong winds toy with your craft, and it already made you hit your head in the cramped capsule a couple times. You just want to leave as fast as possible, but mission control tells you "not yet", and "we’re collecting valuable data from this experience".
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Jorlin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = This thing is spinning pretty fast. Aiming your approach will be difficult, if not impossible.
				SrfLanded = The fast rotation is threatening to throw your craft of the small asteroid.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Mefil
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You have to be careful that your orbit avoids the massive equatorial ridge of this moon.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Crinta
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Its trying very hard to be round, but can’t quite make the cut.
				InSpaceLow = You pass dangerously close over Crinta’s mountain peaks.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Ghorun
			Values
			{
				
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Edith-FG-Barycenter
			Values
			{
				InSpace = What a strange situation to be in, at the mercy of the gravitational influences of two moons at once.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Trultina
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You’ve finally managed to approach one of the moons, and are relatively sure you’re safe from the other’s gravitational pull for now.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Trultosa
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You try to count the craters you’re passing over, but there’s just too many. Not sure how you’re going to land here.
				SrfLandedPolarRegions = This is probably the flattest bit of terrain you can hope to land on here.
				SrfLanded = You’re surrounded by craters and worried your ship may fall over, and into one.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Kaao
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You notice the massive crack in Kaao’s surface. You bet it’d be fun to manouver the craft through there under the low gravity.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Eanuk
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Below you, you see the rough surface of Eanuk. Above you, the entire rest of Edith and its moon system. Its certainly the amazing view that was promised to you.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Frost
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = If you squint your eyes, it almost looks like you’re approaching Avalon. You realize how incredibly homesick you feel.
				InSpaceLow = Frost’s surface is partially obscured by its thick and hazy atmosphere, but you can make out some mountain ranges, and what almost looks like seas.
				Flying = You shiver a bit. Is it just you, or is Frost’s cold seeping into your tiny capsule?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Res
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You struggle to make out Res as anything more than a few bands of glowing orange.
				SrfLanded = The ground is so dark, its almost like you’re still in space. You definitely feel gravity pushing you into your seat, though, a sensation you haven’t felt in a long time.
				SrfSplashed = Shit, go back!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Nanani
			Values
			{
				
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Kallnu
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The moon below you looks like its been fired at with a dispersing laser rifle. You wonder what caused it to take such a pelting.
				SrfLandedLowlands = No problems landing under the low gravity, as expected.
				SrfLandedCraters = You find yourself having landed inside one of the many craters on this moon. You can’t wait to get out and take a look at your surroundings.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Hamaea
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Wait, this is what you came all the way out here for?
				InSpaceLow = If you wanted to see a rocky, cratered surface up close, you could’ve just gone to Ralu.
				SrfLanded = Still questioning why you spent years in a spacecraft to get here, you report to mission control that landing here really wasn’t a big challenge either.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Musoya
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = As this system’s final world comes into view, you contemplate just how far you’ve come.
				InSpaceLow = Musoya’s surface looks nice and calm under its dark blue atmosphere. Landing here should be no problem. You did remember to bring parachutes, right?
				FlyingLow = As your craft slowly passes through the air, you realize how much you miss flying.
				SrfLanded = Looking at the blue sky outside, you want nothing more than to go outside, and take flight again for the first time in years. Mission control informs you that that’s impossible. You try not to cry.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Arkunos
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You spot some streaks of yellow below you, probably some iron deposits close to the surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Talos
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = "The Cutest little comet". You have no Idea why they call it that, but it just feels...right.
				InSpaceLow = Careful, don’t wanna hit the ground too early.
				SrfLanded = You chirp happily as soon as your craft touches down. Mission control sounds confused, asking you to repeat. You chirp again.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Craig
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You recall how this asteroid was named after someone who changed his name to "Craig the Great" after becoming employee of the month at some observatory.
				InSpaceLow = Craig’s surface looks rather unremarkable for an asteroid of its size.
				SrfLanded = In the low gravity, even the most uneven terrain poses no challenge. You’re bored. Mission control also says they’re bored. They suggest going outside, maybe that’ll be exciting.
			}
		}
