		Body
		{
			name = Squad/Sun
			Values
			{
				Flying = You think you got a reading for a split second there, but the instrument is quickly destroyed.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Infernum
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Wait, you’re already hitting atmosphere this far up?
				FlyingLow = The readings from the instrument have become untrustworthy. Its being slowly molten by the heat.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Magnus
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = You try recording the density of the lava using the barometer, but that’s not what it was built for, and it simply bursts into flame instead.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Solvis
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = Pressure isn’t going up as much as you’d like it to.
				SrfLanded = The pressure is way too weak to be habitable. Its barely half of Avalon’s.
				SrfSplashed = The pressure is way too weak to he habitable. Its barely half of Avalon’s.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Valaya
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The pressure is quite extreme here. The barometer is holding on for dear life, but at least still giving good readings.
			}
		}
		//Body
		//{
		//	name = Avalon/Avalon
		//	Values
		//	{
		//		SrfLanded = Normal surface pressure is recorded.
		//		SrfSplashed = Normal sea level pressure is recorded.
		//		FlyingHigh = Pressure is decreasing painfully slowly with altitude. It’ll be a while until space.

		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Nevu
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You can barely even call this an atmosphere at all. There is practically nothing here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Edith
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The pressure reading keeps getting skewed by the strong winds blowing into the instrument.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Frost
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere here is very dense, but not as much as Valaya’s or Edith’s.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = Avalon/Musoya
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This atmosphere is more like a thin veil surrounding the planet. Its surprising not all of it has frozen.
			}
