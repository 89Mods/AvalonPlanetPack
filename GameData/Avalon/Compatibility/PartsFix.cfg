	@description = The MGHE is a single-package solution for testing if an alien world can support Avali life, or if its best for your crew to keep their spacesuits firmly attached to their bodies. It contains a colony of extremophile bacteria that secrete a thick goo-like substance to protect themselves, as well as enough air and nutrition to keep them alive in hibernation for a few decades. If even they can’t survive in whatever hellish conditions you decide to torture them with, then Avali won’t stand a chance either.
